# Predicting Ground Temperature Based on Air Temperature

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict ground temperature using air temperature data. By employing linear regression, the model learns to understand and forecast the relationship between air and ground temperature over time.

## Team Members and Roles
- **Kim Seonjun** - Model Design, Presentation Creation
- **Han Hyunmin** - Data Training
- **Jang Beomsu** - Parameter Adjustment

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Collection and Preparation
   - **Data Source**: Public data from Cheonan region, spanning from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020.
   - **Data Frequency**: Hourly data from 01:00 to 24:00, totaling 8,782 entries.
   - **Initial Data Processing**: Includes checking for missing values, data normalization, and splitting into training and test datasets.

### 2. Data Visualization
   - Basic visualizations were conducted to observe temperature trends over time and examine patterns in the dataset.

### 3. Data Transformation
   - The raw CSV data was converted to a NumPy format to facilitate further analysis.
   - **Dataset Split**: Training data comprises 7,025 entries, while test data consists of 1,757 entries.

### 4. Model Design
   - **Model Type**: Linear Regression was selected due to the statistical relationship between air and ground temperatures.
   - **Features and Target Variable**: Air temperature as input (X) and ground temperature as target output (y).
   - **Optimizer**: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 0.001.

### 5. Training the Model
   - The model calculates predictions by passing input data through the model.
   - **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) was used to compute gradients and update weights.
   - The model was trained iteratively, with loss values tracked to monitor progress.

### 6. Predictions and Visualization
   - Predicted ground temperatures were calculated and converted into NumPy arrays for easier handling.
   - A visualization of actual vs. predicted values was created, showing a positive correlation: as air temperature increases, ground temperature rises correspondingly.

### 7. Testing and Evaluation
   - Various test sizes were examined to evaluate accuracy differences (e.g., 0.8, 0.2 test sizes).

## Areas for Improvement
Future improvements could include incorporating additional factors, such as wind data, and predicting times for daily temperature extremes (e.g., minimum and maximum temperature times).

## Dependencies
- **Python Libraries**: NumPy, Matplotlib (for visualization)
